## Leechy Prototype Software

### Setup

1. Install Python üêç

2.  Use the package manager pip to install selenium and the other packages üì¶.

3. Run those commands from the folder:

```bash
sudo mkdir data data/graph data/graph/drunk data/graph/not_drunk \
    data/frames data/frames/drunk data/frames/not_drunk \
    data/sheet expriences
```

```bash
pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```
    
### Imports

```python
import cv2, pickle, xlsxwriter, time, datetime, os, os.path
from imutils import rotate_bound
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.widgets import Button
from PIL import Image, ImageTk
```

### Get Started

**MAKE SURE KEYBOARD IS ON ENGLISH AND CAPSLOCK ISN'T ON!**
After doing all the setup connect the prototype and run the python script with ```py main.py```. 

### Control The Program

To control the basic things in the software, after putting the finger inside the prototype and seeing the input from the camera on the screen there are several basic commands you can do:
- select the spectrum manually with the mouse.
- "/" - autofind the spectrum.
- "p" - plotting the spectrum (only after locking on it).
- "o" - close the graph.
- "l" - live mode, the graph will always change in real time.
- "k" - save current graph as "not drunk" for comparsion, only at live mode.
- "g" - pause the all program.
